# Purple Pool App

Purple Pool is a mobile app designed to help teens and pre-teens cultivate self-compassion as they face the mental health challenges of today's world. With a youth-friendly avatar-driven interface, the app provides a wide range of evidence-based tools to help them build resilience, emotional regulation, and proficiency in self-care.

## Overview

Adolescence is a critical period of neurophysiological growth, and the changes occurring in the brain during this time present opportunities for positive change and recovery from adversity. The Purple Pool app aims to address the mental health crisis among teens and pre-teens, which has been exacerbated by factors such as the climate crisis, economic instability, global pandemic, and the pervasive influence of social media platforms.

Based on the acclaimed work of Lorraine Gonzales-Hobbs and Niina Tamura in Teaching Self-Compassion to Teens, and the forthcoming workbook, A Self-Compassion Workbook for Kids by Lorraine Gonzales-Hobbs and Amy Balentine, the Purple Pool app reimagines proven activities as fun, quick, self-guided interactive experiences. This provides an alternative phone-based tool to combat the harmful effects of social media and mobile phone culture.

The app is designed to meet teens where they are and provide resources for solving social and emotional challenges they face daily. With a focus on reaching diverse audiences and underserved communities, the app is specifically committed to serving Spanish-speaking communities.
